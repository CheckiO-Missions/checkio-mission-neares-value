        I have no idea how to start solving this mission!
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Well, the idea I offer you for the clear and gradual solving this mission is the following.
        First of all, you have to declare variables for distance and your future closest number.
        Then, by checking each number in the set, you should calculate the distance between the number and the input number.
        In case this distance is less then stored in variable, update variables with new distance and closest number.
        In case the distance is the same, check if the number is less than the stored one. If so - update the stored number.
        Return the stored number after checking all the set in such way.

        It looks clear, but my code still does not work. Which functions should I use to implement the idea into code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For successfully solving the mission in my way you just need to find distance with <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs">abs()</a>, to choose the smaller number with <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min">min()</a>
            and to move over the set use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for">for</a> loop.

        Can you please point me out at some exact code blocks?

    <div class="answer">
        Let's look at more precise code description:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
    def nearest_value(values: set[int], one: int) -> int:

        min_dist, closest_num  = None, None # declare the initial distance and closest number
        # use for loop to iterate over the values:
            dist = # use abs() to calculate distance between current
                    # value from the set and the input one
            if min_dist == None or min_dist > dist: # check if initial distance does
                                        # not exist or is bigger then calculated
                # update stored min_dist and closest_num with new values
            elif min_dist == dist: # if distance is the same as stored
                closest_num = ... # use min() to store the smaller number

        return closest_num
        </pre>

        One last question. How my final solution will look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Here it is:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def nearest_value(values: set[int], one: int) -> int:

    min_dist, closest_num  = None, None
    for value in values:
        dist = abs(one - value)
        if min_dist == None or min_dist > dist:
            min_dist, closest_num = dist, value
        elif min_dist == dist:
            closest_num = min(value, closest_num)
        
    return closest_num
        </pre>

        Sure, grab it!<br />
        Much shorter solution, where you find minimum value in set by two parameters:
        first is distance (absolute difference) from the input number, second: smaller value
        between two on the same distance 
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def nearest_value(values: set[int], one: int) -> int:

    return min(values, key=lambda n: (abs(one - n), n))        
        </pre>
        In this solution you start from "one" and increasing and decreasing it
        check if this new value is in set.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def nearest_value(values: set[int], one: int) -> int:

    n = 0
    while True:
        if (one - n) in values:
            return one - n
        if (one + n) in values:
            return one + n
        n += 1
