<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Find the nearest value to the given one.
</p>
<p>
    You are given {% if is_js %}an Array of numbers{% else %}a set of integers{% endif %}
    and a value for which you need to find the nearest one.
</p>
<p>
    For example, we have the following sequence of numbers: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17,
    and we need to find the nearest value to the number 9. If we sort this sequence
    in the ascending order, then to the left of number 9 will be number 7 and to
    the right - will be number 10. But 10 is closer than 7, which means that the correct answer is 10.
</p>

<p>A few clarifications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If 2 numbers are at the same distance, you need to choose the smallest one;</li>
    <li>The sequence of numbers is always non-empty;</li>
    <li>The given value can be in this sequence, which means that it’s the answer;</li>
    <li>The sequence may contain both positive and negative numbers, but they are always integers;</li>
    <li>The sequence isn’t sorted and consists only unique numbers.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> Two arguments. {% if is_js %}An Array of numbers{% else %}a set of integers{% endif %}. The sought value as {% if is_js %}a number{% else %}an integer{% endif %}.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> {% if is_js %}A number{% else %}An integer{% endif %}.
